This course will teach students how to solve practical spatial problems using cutting edge Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. Students will identify interdisciplinary questions amenable to spatial solutions, learn how to collect and curate geographic information, and design real-world mapping applications. By the end of the course, students will have gained familiarity with multiple types of GIS systems, and be able to select which system best fits their research needs. In addition, students will share and develop their geographic analyses with community stakeholders.  Lead mentors: Lindsey Fox and Richard Stringer-Hye.


## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this course, the student will:

* Identify and solve spatial problems
* Learn how to collect and curate geographic information
* Gain a familiarity wiht multiple GIS systems

## Texts and readings:

* [Nature of Geographic Information Systems by David DiBiase](http://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/BookDetail.aspx?bookId=428)  

## Software

This course will use a variety of GIS tools, including:  

* ArcGIS- This software only works with a Windows environment and is availble through the software store or on the lab computers in Stevenson 2200
* QGIS-  This is the open-source alternative to ArcGIS and is compatible with most operating systems

## Assignments & Evaluation:

This course will be graded on a pass/fail basis. To pass the course, students must not have more than two unexcused absences. 

* Practical GIS Exercises
* Project Presentation 
* GIS Project 
* Peer Evaulation of GIS Project
